## Agenda

This meeting is to discuss the future of interoperability with cookies.

Presently, there are significant differences between implementations, even if we disregard the cases where third-party cookies remain enabled. Details can be found in the linked issue.

The goal will be to discuss differences, the implications for interoperability (both between browsers and site compatibility), and try to find agreement about how to align implementations.
